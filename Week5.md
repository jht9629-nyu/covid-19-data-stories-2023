### Course Project Feedback

An important part of the final class is student feedback on the projects of your peers. We have found that this is invaluable especially for students who intend to pursue their project beyond the 3 week class.

- Verbal feedback: (self explanatory)
- Written feedback:
  Please use this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yaIkXv-9pWO7EXLHiZVtGSD0mAFZCRFuj5IlfybAfhU/edit?usp=sharing) to write your feedback in the row with the presenter's name and add your initials. A sample is in the doc.
