### Course Project Feedback

An important part of the final class is student feedback on the projects of your peers. We have found that this is invaluable especially for students who intend to pursue their project beyond the 3 week class.

- Verbal feedback: (self explanatory)
- Written feedback:
  Please use this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X0ctAIQgSPUy_RaskWOxGr9BiTLJ9XaZmBmWhDhW3Sg/edit) to write your feedback in the row with the presenter's name and add your initials. A sample is in the doc.

## STORYTELLING
- Stories are an important piece of the fabric that weaves together our collective humanity.
- A story can provide a mirror or a window to someone elseâ€™s lived experience, engendering empathy and a sense of connection.
- Stories are also important stewards of our past and present experiences and can motivate us to envision a better future.

### Examples of slow data storytelling: 
**Data Visualization Projects by [Matt Korostoff](https://mkorostoff.github.io/)**

Matt is a software developer who proclaims himself waging a "war on [scope insensitivity](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2ftJ38y9SRBCBsCzy/scope-insensitivity)."
- [How much Money?](https://mkorostoff.github.io/1-pixel-wealth/) Full of surprises, this visualizatoin takes you on a ride that will question your understanding of wealth, money and poverty.
- [Incaceration in the United States](https://mkorostoff.github.io/incarceration-in-real-numbers/) Similarly using simple interactions, this data artist forces us to slow down and think about the United State's culture of imprisonment.
