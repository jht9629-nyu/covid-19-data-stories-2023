### SOME NOTES ON DATA LITERACY*

Data is a set of numerical values described by qualitative and quantitative variables.
Data visualizations (graphs, charts, maps and other creative visualizations) should:

- Have a clear title and purpose
- Provide insight into the data
- Make clear what the visualization represents
- Make it's intention clear within moments
- Reveal trends and patterns if they exist
- Provide easy access to insights into the data

In addition:

- If outliers in the data exist they should be easy to spot
- The completeness of the data should be explained
- A data literate consumer should be able to spot whether the author deliberately excluded or hid relevant data

In creating or examining visualizations ask:

- Can I answer all of my questions with what I see, or do I need more data?
- ​Is it clear what has been measured, and what the numbers represent?
- Are there helpful notes, labels, and navigational hints?
- Can the viewer gather useful and actionable data from this visualization?

## HOMEWORK
#### SUBMITTING YOUR WORK

- Submit homework to your folder on the [2023 CLASS GOOGLE DRIVE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10LzZNPTCnpLnLxpQN9ewITFg9ku76L9l)

#### DUE WEEK 3:- Put your work in the folder labeled "Week 2"

1. **Reflect on Week 2 class.** Think about whether you might like to contribute to building the project or creating a new piece of work for your final project. _Be prepared to discuss in class._

2. **THE COVID TRACKING PROJECT:** https://revealnews.org/article/covid-tracking-project/
   This three-part podcast series exposes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC's) bungled response to COVID-19 in the early days of the pandemic and takes listeners inside the massive volunteer effort to collect data about tests, cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the U.S. The United States has 4% of the world’s population, but 16% of COVID-19 deaths. This podcast series investigates the failures that led to over 1 million Americans dying from COVID-19 and what that tells us about the nation’s ability to respond to the next pandemic. This three-part series was reported by Artis Curiskis and Kara Oehler and hosted by infectious disease expert Jessica Malaty Rivera.

- **Listen to Episode 2 of the COVID Tracking Project podcast (50 mins).** https://revealnews.org/article/covid-tracking-project/
- In a medium of your choice, react to at least one thing that caught your attention. (essay, poetry, prose, art etc)

3. **Choose a new data vizzies or one from last week's homework.** Put screenshots, images (if from printed material) and links if relevant into your Week 2 Google folder.  Analyze the vizzie through the lens of data literacy as we discussed in class.  For the vizzie you chose, write down your answers to the following questions:

  -  What is the source of the data?
  -  What does the chart/graph/visualization represent?
  -  Is there a clear title and purpose?
  -  Is the title informative/accurate/misleading/vague?  COuld you suggest a more accurate or informative title?
  -  Can you understand the intent of the visualization in a few moments?
  -  Is there enough auxiliary information to help you decode the data?  What auxiliary information is provided?  How is it provided?
  -  Does the visualization allow you to access granularity?
  -  What insight into the data does the visualization provide?
  -  Do any particular patterns or trends emerge?  If so, what are they?
