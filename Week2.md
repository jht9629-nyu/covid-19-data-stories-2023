### SOME NOTES ON DATA LITERACY/EXTRACTING STORIES FROM DATA\*

Data is a set of numerical values described by qualitative and quantitative variables.
Data visualizations (graphs, charts, maps and other creative visualizatoins) should:

- Have a clear title and purpose
- Provide insight into the data?
- Make clear what the visualization represents
- Make it's intention clear within moments
- Reveal trends and patterns if they exist
- Provide easy access to insights into the data

In addition:

- If outliers in the data exist they should be easy to spot
- The completeness of the data should be explained
- A data literate consumer should be able to spot whether the author deliberately excluded or hid relevant data

In creating or examining visualizations ask:

- Can I answer all of my questions with what I see, or do I need more data?
- â€‹Is it clear what has been measured, and what the numbers represent?
- Has the author included helpful notes, labels, and navigational hints?
- Can you gather useful and actionable data from this visualization?
