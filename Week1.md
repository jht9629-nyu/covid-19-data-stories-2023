### DATA VISUALIZATION PIONEERS

#### Florence Nightingale

Florence Nightingale, aka the "Lady with the Lamp", best known for her nursing work during the Crimean war. She was a nurse and a statistician who collected and analysed data on the deaths of soldiers in Crimean war. The data showed that more soldiers were dying from infectious diseases due to unsanitary conditions and poor ventilation than from wounds of war and other causes. Florence Nightingale instituted reforms to mitigate these outcomes. She created visualizations to communicate her findings and the results of her interventions to the general public.

#### W. E. B. DuBois

"The core mission of Du Bois’s sociological research was to forcefully refute the widespread belief that black Americans were innately inferior and incapable of social advancement.”

### SOME NOTES ON DATA LITERACY/EXTRACTING STORIES FROM DATA\*

Data is a set of numerical values described by qualitative and quantitative variables.
Data visualizations (graphs, charts, maps and other creative visualizatoins) should:

- Have a clear title and purpose
- Provide insight into the data?
- Make clear what the visualization represents
- Make it's intention clear within moments
- Reveal trends and patterns if they exist
- Provide easy access to insights into the data

In addition:

- If outliers in the data exist they should be easy to spot
- The completeness of the data should be explained
- A data literate consumer should be able to spot whether the author deliberately excluded or hid relevant data

In creating or examining visualizations ask:

- Can I answer all of my questions with what I see, or do I need more data?
- ​Is it clear what has been measured, and what the numbers represent?
- Has the author included helpful notes, labels, and navigational hints?
- Can you gather useful and actionable data from this visualization?
