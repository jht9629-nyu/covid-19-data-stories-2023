### DATA VISUALIZATION PIONEERS

#### Florence Nightingale

Florence Nightingale, aka the "Lady with the Lamp", best known for her nursing work during the Crimean war. She was a nurse and a statistician who collected and analysed data on the deaths of soldiers in Crimean war. The data showed that more soldiers were dying from infectious diseases due to unsanitary conditions and poor ventilation than from wounds of war and other causes. Florence Nightingale instituted reforms to mitigate these outcomes. She created visualizations to communicate her findings and the results of her interventions to the general public.

   This three-part podcast series exposes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC's) bungled response to COVID-19 in the early days of the pandemic and takes listeners inside the massive volunteer effort to collect data about tests, cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the U.S. The United States has 4% of the world’s population, but 16% of COVID-19 deaths. This podcast series investigates the failures that led to over 1 million Americans dying from COVID-19 and what that tells us about the nation’s ability to respond to the next pandemic. This three-part series was reported by Artis Curiskis and Kara Oehler and hosted by infectious disease expert Jessica Malaty Rivera.

- **Listen to Episode 1 of the COVID Tracking Project podcast (50 mins).** https://revealnews.org/article/covid-tracking-project/
- In a medium of your choice, react to at least one thing that caught your attention. (essay, poetry, prose, art etc)

3. **Choose 2 data vizzies that you would like to share with the class.** Put screenshots, images (if from printed material) and links if relevant into your Week 1 Google folder.

- Why did you choose those vizzies?
- Describe what the vizzie is trying to convey and how.
