### HOMEWORK:
1. **THE COVID TRACKING PROJECT:** https://revealnews.org/article/covid-tracking-project/
   This three-part podcast series exposes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC's) bungled response to COVID-19 in the early days of the pandemic and takes listeners inside the massive volunteer effort to collect data about tests, cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the U.S. The United States has 4% of the world’s population, but 16% of COVID-19 deaths. This podcast series investigates the failures that led to over 1 million Americans dying from COVID-19 and what that tells us about the nation’s ability to respond to the next pandemic. This three-part series was reported by Artis Curiskis and Kara Oehler and hosted by infectious disease expert Jessica Malaty Rivera.
