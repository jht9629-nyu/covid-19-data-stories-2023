# Data Storytelling for Memory Making and Social Resilience

## Lecture

ITPG-GT 

Location: 370 Jay Street, Room Room 410 Loc: Brooklyn Campus

Instructors: John Henry Thompson; Shindy Johnson

## Course Description

This course will use the open source [The COVID-19 Impact Project](https://itp.nyu.edu/covid19impactproject/) as an entry point to explore humanizing data on systemic inequity and injustice on a global and local scale. 

In this course we will:

● Explore and invent creative uses of data for advocacy and change. 

● Discover how data flows from public github repositories and tools needed to visualize the data. 

● Review other data-centric open source projects for the public good and discuss the questions they are trying to answer or problems they are trying to solve. 

● Examine and draw inspiration from historical and contemporary data visualizations developed by advocates for social justice and the public good. 

● Use data visualization as a scaffold to explore ways to support community driven mourning and memorialization after mass death events. 

Students can choose to participate as creatives, artists, javascript coders, p5js explorers, UI/UX designers, citizen journalists, data science explorers or social justice advocates.

## Course Outline

● Open Source Projects for the Public Good

● Data: Sourcing, Humanizing and Creating Visual Narratives from Data

● Storytelling with and from Data

● Data storytelling as a scaffold to support grief, ritual and memorialization after mass death events

** _Students wishing to pursue their final projects beyond the class will be provided with information about resources at NYU for supporting student projects that amplify underrepresented narratives._  

** _Students wishing to continue their participation in The COVID-19 Impact Project after the course ends should notify us as we are seeking grant funding to implement viable concepts._
