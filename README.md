## Course Description

This course will use the open source [The COVID-19 Impact Project](https://covid19impactproject.com/) as a basis to explore ways to humanize the unfolding data on the coronavirus pandemic. Students are invited to collaborate on the COVID-19 Impact Project. Students will discover how data flows from public github repositories and tools needed to visualize the data. We will review other data-centric open source projects related to COVID-19 and discuss the questions they are trying to answer or problems they are trying to solve. We will examine historical and contemporary data visualizations. Using data visualization as a scaffold, we will explore ways to support community driven mourning and memorialization. Students can choose to participate as javascript coders, p5js explorers, UI/UX designers, citizen journalists, or data science explorers.

## Course Structure

Students will participate in lectures, research, discussion groups, hands on design and build
activities and group or individual projects. Students will be expected to dedicate at least 3 hours of work on weekly assignments in between sessions.

**[Week 1:]()** Structure, developement and components of the Covid-19 Impact Project. Data for Community Driven Mourning and Memorialization. Assignment: impact of the pandemic on you or your community.
