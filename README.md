# Data Storytelling for Social Resilience

## Lecture

ITPG-GT 

Location: 370 Jay Street, Room Room 410 Loc: Brooklyn Campus

Instructors: John Henry Thompson; Shindy Johnson

## Course Description

This course will use the open source [The COVID-19 Impact Project](https://itp.nyu.edu/covid19impactproject/) as an entry point to explore humanizing data on global and local systemic inequity, and creative uses of using data for advocacy and change. Students will discover how data flows from public github repositories and tools needed to visualize the data. We will review other data-centric open source projects for the public good and discuss the questions they are trying to answer or problems they are trying to solve. We will examine and drawinspiration from historical and contemporary data visualizations developed by advocates for social justice and the public good. Using data visualization as a scaffold, we will explore ways to support community driven mourning and memorialization after mass death events. 

Students can choose to participate as javascript coders, p5js explorers, UI/UX designers, citizen journalists, or data science explorers.

## Course Outline
