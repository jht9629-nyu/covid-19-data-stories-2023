● _Explore_ different modes of data storytelling

● _Develop_ new data stories according to student interest

● _Clarify_ pandemic stories through data disaggregation

<!-- ● Explore and invent creative uses of data for advocacy and change.

● Discover how data flows from public github repositories and tools needed to visualize the data.

● Examine and draw inspiration from historical and contemporary data visualizations developed by advocates for social justice and the public good. -->

<!-- ● Review other data-centric open source projects for the public good and discuss the questions they are trying to answer or problems they are trying to solve.

● Use data visualization as a scaffold to explore ways to support community driven mourning and memorialization after mass death events. -->

Students can choose to participate as creatives, artists, javascript coders, p5js explorers, UI/UX designers, citizen journalists, data science explorers or social justice advocates.

## Course Outline

● Open Source Projects for the Public Good

● Data: Sourcing, Humanizing and Creating Visual Narratives from Data

● Storytelling with and from Data

● Data storytelling as a scaffold to support grief, ritual and memorialization after mass death events
